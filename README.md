# Py All The Things
>English words which could easily have "py" substituted in them, to help generate Python package names (Python3 terminal tool)

This project is a tool to generate Python package project names which follow the style of using "py" in the title. It is intended for use by other Python developers who are looking for names for their new projects. The idea is inspired by working with project with names such as _PyDictionary_, _Jupyter_ or _tweepy_ and realising their must be a systematic way to find words like those.

The logic is to iterate through all words in the English language, exclude the words which are too long or short and filter to the words following the required pattern.
